This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to **add, view, edit, and delete** user data efficiently. The UI is designed with **MUI components** for a modern look, and the backend ensures seamless data handling with **MongoDB and Mongoose**. ðŸš€
